# BouincingBallsAndRectangles
This is a program written in Java that simulates perfect elastic collisions, a fundamental concept in physics where two bodies bounce off each other without any loss of kinetic energy. In this simulation, the objects involved are circles and rectangles.

The program calculates the precise outcomes of collisions considering the masses, velocities, and angles of the entities. As the circles and rectangles collide, the program ensures conservation of both momentum and kinetic energy, consistent with the principles of perfect elasticity.

The program does not currently include a user interface for adding additional circles and rectangles dynamically. If one wish to alter the number of objects or their properties one must directly edit the source code. This could involve adjusting parameters or adding new object instances within the codebase.

For ease of use and accessibility, the program has been compiled into a runnable JAR file.
